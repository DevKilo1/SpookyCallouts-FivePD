Installation:
 - Drag and drop SpookyCallouts.net.dll into your fivepd/callouts folder!
 - [Optional] Install PlayCustomSounds [https://github.com/LondonStudios/PlayCustomSounds] and add the provided sounds (inside the PROVIDED PlayCustomSounds/html/sounds folder)      into the PlayCustomSounds/html/sounds folder! (This adds the horror and dialogue sounds. If you don't want one of these sounds, you can remove them or switch them out as long as you keep the name and audio format (.OGG) then it'll work!)
 - [Optional] Install KiloMultiverse (FULL RESOURCE PROVIDED). This will send the player into a new dimension for the purpose of the callout, and yes this is intended for the callout. The idea is the player cannot receive help from his buddies who would otherwise make it too easy to investigate something that is meant to be impossible.

Note from DevKilo:
   This callout will only appear ambiently between October 21st and November 9th, so you can keep the callout in all-year-long if you want.
Thank you for downloading this and I hope you enjoy it!
